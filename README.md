Computer Science I - coursework
Instructions per course:
LAB 3 - Task:
Write a program that computes your phone bill for the month. Your bill is based on the number of hours of phone use, along with your package. Here are the different packages:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic package: For $9.95 per month 10 hours of access are provided. Additional hours are $2.00 per hour.
Gold package: For $14.95 per month 20 hours of access are provided. Additional hours are $1.00 per hour.
Platinum package: For $19.95 per month unlimited access is provided.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a program that ask the user to enter their package plan, along with the total hours they have used for the month.
Then, compute the bill amount
Finally, tell the user how much their bill is for the month.
Make sure that your bill values are formatted as money (always displaying only 2 decimals, never more nor less)

LAB 4 - Task:
Write a program to play the Hi-Lo guessing game! In particular, your program should:
 Generate a random number from 1 to 100.
 Ask the user to guess the number
 If the user is right, the game ends
 If the user's guess is too high or too low, the program informs the user of that fact and asks for another guess.
 This repeats until the user gets the number correct
Further, your program should keep track of how many guesses the user takes to get the number right.  An appropriate comment should then be issued to the user.  For example: 
        11 or more "What a terrible score!..." 
        9-10       "Not too shabby, but not too good either... 
        7-8        "That's pretty good but you can do better..." 
        5-6        "That's a very good score..." 
        0-4        "Amazing! Or was it luck?
